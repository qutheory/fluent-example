# Fluent Example

1. Make sure to have `sqlite3` installed (see **Install SQLite** bellow)
2. Run `swift package update` to download dependencies
3. Run `swift build` to build the example application
4. Execute the program `.build/debug/FluentApp`

View [Fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent) for documentation.

Swift 3.0 or later is required.

## Install SQLite

Install the `sqlite3` package. It's recommended to use a package manager:

On macOS use [brew](http://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install sqlite3
```

On Ubuntu use `apt-get`

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

Works on macOS and Ubuntu.
